# 👋 Hi, I’m Said Dev

Full-stack developer focused on **B2B web services, platforms, and systems with complex business and financial logic**.  
I design and build products that scale, automate processes, and remain maintainable as the business grows.


## 🧠 What I Do

I don’t just write code. I:
- analyze business requirements;
- design scalable architectures;
- implement complex role models, permissions, and calculations;
- integrate external services and payment systems;

I work where **reliability, scalability, and predictability** matter.
